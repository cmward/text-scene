TODO:
- Rewrite command line interfaces using argparse
- Fix ParallelColumnCNN
- refactor data loaders into data loaders and feature extractors
- use SGDClassifier for maxent so we don't have to use lbfgs
- change food/drink label to be unambiguous (vs. domestic kitchen)
- experiment logging
- command for full suite of classifiers > log
