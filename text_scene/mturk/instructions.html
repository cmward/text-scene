<p>In this task you will answer four questions about an
image to determine the location of what's shown in the image.</p>

<p><b>Question 1</b>: Is the image showing a location that's indoors or
outdoors?
<br></br>
Any building or vehical interior is indoors, while anything that you could
consider to be 'outside' is outdoors.
<br></br>
<i>Select one answer for this question.</i></p>

<p><b>Question 2</b>: Is the location in the image natural or man-made?
<br></br>
Natural locations are places that can be found in nature, or in the wild,
while man-made locations have been constructed by humans.
<br></br>
<i>Select one answer for this question.</i></p>

<p><b>Select an answer for either Question 3 or Question 4,
but not both.</b> If the location is man-made, select a function in
Question 3 and don't select anything for Question 4. If the location is
natural, select a natural location type in Question 4 and don't select
anything for Question 3.</p>

<p><b>Question 3</b>: If the location is man-made, what is its type or function?
<br></br>
<i>Only select an answer for this question if you've selected 'man-made'
for Question 2.</i>
<br></br>
For each possible answer, here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Transportation/urban: streets, sidewalks, city squares and plazas, car interiors, airports</li>
    <li>Restaurant: bars, restaurants. Does not include kitchens in houses
or apartments, which would be 'domestic'.</li>
    <li>Recreation: athletic facilities, sports fields, dance clubs, concert venues, arcades, parks, gardens</li>
    <li>Domestic: Interiors and exteriors of houses and apartments</li>
    <li>Work/education: shops, office buildings, schools, farms, doctor's offices</li>
    <li>Other/Unclear: any location that doesn't fit into the previous categories or if the location cannot be determined from the image</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to answer this question with respect to the location, not what
the people in the picture are doing. For example, if the image shows
children playing a game in the street or workers doing construction on a
sidewalk, the correct answer would be 'transportation/urban', since streets and
sidewalks are used for transportation.</p>

<p><b>Question 4</b>: If the location in the picture is natural, what kind
of natural location is it?
<br></br>
<i>Only select an answer for this question if you've selected 'natural' for
Question 2.</i>
<br></br>
For each possible answer, here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Body of water: lake, ocean, river, beach</li>
    <li>Field: any (usually grassy) open field</li>
    <li>Mountain: any part of a mountain or a similar elevated, usually rocky, location</li>
    <li>Forest/jungle: Location covered with trees, undergrowth, or vegetation</li>
    <li>Other/unclear: Any outside natural locations that don't fit into the previous categories or if the location cannot be determined from the image.</li>
</ul>
